## Long term ideas

- `whatnow [--human | --csv] [--wide | --long]` 

- Append-only modifications to project metadata

  Add modifications to a comment in the issue; have whatnow use the last
  modification.
  
- Placeholders in Forecast should have the same names as column headings in the
  Project Tracker.

  Furthermore, placeholders should only exist for projects with confirmed
  funding.
