# Whatnow

What am I supposed to be working on at the moment? How are my projects going?
This is a collection of scripts for answering those questions, assuming you work
in REG at the Turing.

## Background

REG uses three systems for project management.

1. GitHub issues. Each of our projects has a unique GitHub issue in the Hut23
   repo. We organise these into three GitHub “projects” (like kanban boards),
   which themselves are organised by the phase of the project.
   
2. A commercial system, Harvest, which we use for time tracking.

3. An add-on to Harvest, called Forecast, which we use for scheduling.

Whatnow collects data from all three and reports summary information for
specified projects (usually those for which the current user is


## Usage (vapourware)

### Typical questions

1. What projects am I supposed to be working on?
2. For projects of interest, 
   - are timesheets up to date?
   - are we on track?
   - where are we?
3. Projects of interest are:
   - projects where I am listed as project lead on GitHub
   - projects I'm working on
   - projects my reports are working on
